            <h2 class="card-title">Overview</h2>
            <p>FanHub is a loyalty and engagement platform built for football fans — rewarding real-world fandom and turning matchday behaviour into measurable value for clubs and brands.</p>
            <p>As co-founder and Chief Product Officer, I helped build FanHub from zero to a live consumer platform used by tens of thousands of fans every month. The core idea is simple but ambitious: fans prove their loyalty by turning up, predicting games, and choosing the right places on matchday — and we reward them for it.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">How It Worked</h2>
            <p>The product blended consumer engagement mechanics with a performance-driven commercial model underneath:</p>
            <ul class="icon-list">
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span><strong>Check-ins:</strong> Stadium check-ins proven with geolocation</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span><strong>Predictions:</strong> Fans prove their knowledge and competed against others on leaderboards, including lineup and results predictions</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span><strong>Mystery rewards:</strong> Surprise incentives to drive discovery and delight</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span><strong>Progression systems:</strong> Tiered mechanics that rewarded consistency</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span><strong>LYLTY currency:</strong> A proprietary blockchain-based points system fans earned and redeemed</span></li>
            </ul>

        <article class="bento-card project-section-card">
            <h2 class="card-title">What I Led</h2>
            <p>I focused on building a contagious app — one that fans wanted to share, talk about, and bring their friends into.</p>
            <ul class="icon-list">
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span><strong>Rapid organic growth:</strong> Drove viral growth across social platforms by understanding what made fans want to share — their predictions, their leaderboard positions, their rewards</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span><strong>User psychology:</strong> Applied deep understanding of fan behaviour to design features that felt natural, rewarding, and worth talking about</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span><strong>Contagious mechanics:</strong> Built systems that turned every fan action into a potential share moment, creating momentum that spread organically</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span><strong>Bold experiments:</strong> Did things that seemed crazy at the time — like launching a waitlist that created scarcity and demand, turning "you can't get in yet" into "you need to get in"</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span><strong>Team building:</strong> Hired nearly every person and built the entire product and tech team from scratch</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span><strong>Tech culture:</strong> Created a culture of high velocity yet stable outcome-driven tech delivery</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span><strong>Content strategy:</strong> Led content strategy for long periods — our socials were popping</span></li>
            </ul>

        <article class="bento-card project-section-card">
            <h2 class="card-title">What I Learned</h2>
            <p>Building FanHub taught me how hard — and how rewarding — it is to ship real products in ambiguous conditions:</p>
            <ul class="icon-list">
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span>Balancing user delight with commercial reality</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span>Simplifying complex systems for mass-market users</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span>Taking full ownership of outcomes rather than hiding behind process</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's the foundation of how I think about product today: start with human behaviour, design systems that create momentum, and only build things that can survive contact with the real world.</p>
