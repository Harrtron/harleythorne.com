                    <h2>What It Was</h2>
                    <p>FanHub was a sports loyalty platform designed to reward football fans for their engagement and passion. The platform connected fans with their favorite clubs, offering a way to earn rewards, access exclusive content, and deepen their connection to the teams they support.</p>
                    <p>Built from the ground up, FanHub addressed a fundamental gap in how sports organizations engaged with their most passionate supporters. Rather than treating fans as passive consumers, we created a system that recognized and rewarded active participation—whether that was attending matches, engaging with content, or participating in community activities.</p>

                    <h2>What I Achieved</h2>
                    <p>As Co-Founder, I took broad ownership across product, growth, commercial strategy, hiring, and internal operations. I stepped into whatever area was most critical at each stage, ensuring we maintained momentum and shipped consistently.</p>

                    <h3>Product & Vision</h3>
                    <p>I defined and evolved the product vision, ensuring roadmap decisions were directly tied to commercial goals and user engagement. I designed and shipped multiple core product loops that drove both user acquisition and retention. The product went from zero to live users to revenue, with each iteration informed by real user behavior and feedback.</p>

                    <h3>Growth & Traction</h3>
                    <p>I designed and ran growth experiments across social, CRM, and product-led loops, with a strong focus on speed and learning. This approach helped us grow to 200,000 registered users and 50,000+ monthly active users. Every experiment taught us something, and we moved fast enough to capitalize on what worked.</p>

                    <h3>Commercial & Strategy</h3>
                    <p>I worked directly on partner pitches and commercial conversations, translating external opportunities into product and revenue strategy. This wasn't just sales—it was about understanding what partners needed and building products that created mutual value.</p>

                    <h3>Fundraising</h3>
                    <p>I supported fundraising efforts, including pitch decks, metrics, and investor storytelling. We raised $3m+ in venture capital funding, which enabled us to scale the team and accelerate product development.</p>

                    <h3>Team & Culture</h3>
                    <p>I led and inspired cross-functional teams, maintaining morale and pace through rapid change, uncertainty, and aggressive timelines. I built internal systems to keep teams aligned, focused, and shipping. The culture we created was one of clarity, trust, and high standards—shaped through action rather than process.</p>

                    <h3>Operations</h3>
                    <p>I acted as a day-to-day right-hand to the CEO, helping prioritize what mattered most and pushing execution forward under pressure. This meant making decisions with incomplete information, building systems that created momentum, and ensuring we never lost sight of the bigger picture while executing on the details.</p>

                    <h2>The Impact</h2>
                    <p>FanHub demonstrated that you can build something meaningful from scratch—from concept to live users to revenue to venture funding. The platform created value for fans, clubs, and partners, proving that loyalty programs could be more than transactional rewards. They could be systems that deepened relationships and created genuine engagement.</p>
                    <p>The experience taught me that building something from zero requires equal parts imagination and execution. You need vision to see what's possible, but you also need the discipline to ship, learn, and iterate. Most importantly, you need to step into whatever area needs attention, regardless of job titles or predefined roles.</p>
