                    <h2>What Is Nudge?</h2>
                    <p>Nudge is a gentle app for couples who want to feel more connected while getting everyday life done.</p>
                    <p>It's designed for real relationships — especially when one partner struggles to get started, remember things, or follow through, and the other ends up feeling like they're always asking or reminding.</p>
                    <p>Instead of nagging or pressure, Nudge turns small actions into moments of connection.</p>

                    <h2>How It Works</h2>
                    <p>One partner adds simple tasks ("Things") they'd like help with. The other completes them in a satisfying, ADHD-friendly way — by scribbling them out, one at a time.</p>
                    <p>When something's done, it's visible. When effort happens, it's noticed. And when it's noticed, it can be appreciated.</p>
                    <p>Alongside tasks, Nudge also creates gentle "Moments" — small prompts for kindness or connection — like a hug, a smile, or a few minutes together. These aren't chores. They're just little reminders that relationships are built in the in-between.</p>

                    <h2>Why Nudge Is Different</h2>
                    <p>Nudge isn't about productivity, fairness, or tracking who does more.</p>
                    <p>There are no streaks, no scores, no guilt, no dashboards.</p>
                    <p>It's built around a simple idea: when effort feels good and gets noticed, people show up more naturally.</p>
                    <p>That's especially powerful for couples where ADHD, overwhelm, or busy lives make communication harder than it needs to be.</p>

                    <h2>What Nudge Helps With</h2>
                    <ul class="project-list">
                        <li>Reducing nagging and tension</li>
                        <li>Making effort visible without arguments</li>
                        <li>Helping partners feel appreciated</li>
                        <li>Turning small wins into positive momentum</li>
                        <li>Building connection in a busy world</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It's not therapy. It's not a to-do list. It's a kinder way to support each other.</p>

                    <h2>Who It's For</h2>
                    <p>Nudge is for couples who love each other, get stuck on the small stuff, want things to feel lighter not heavier, and are tired of arguing about chores or follow-through.</p>
                    <p>Especially when one partner struggles more with initiation or organisation.</p>

                    <h2>The Idea Behind It</h2>
                    <p>Nudge was inspired by a simple truth: crossing something off a list together feels better than talking about why it didn't get done.</p>
                    <p>Nudge helps couples replace pressure with progress — and progress with connection.</p>
