            <p>Nudge is an app that helps couples get everyday things done without friction.</p>
            <p>It's built for relationships where one person struggles more with starting or remembering tasks, and the other ends up carrying the mental load. Instead of nagging or repeated reminders, Nudge makes effort visible and easier to act on.</p>

                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span>Momentum builds</span></li>

            <p>Moments and Treats sit alongside this to keep things balanced.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Key Features</h2>
            <p><strong>Things (tasks)</strong></p>
            <p>One partner adds tasks ("Things"). The other completes them by scribbling them out — a simple interaction that helps reduce overwhelm and makes finishing feel clear.</p>
            <p>The app focuses on one thing at a time, rather than long lists.</p>
            <p><strong>Moments</strong></p>
            <p>Nudge occasionally adds short prompts for connection, like a hug or a few minutes together.</p>
            <p>They're optional and lightweight, and they don't affect progress. They exist to keep things human, not to add more work.</p>
            <p><strong>Appreciation</strong></p>
            <p>When something is completed, the other partner can send a quick reaction or message.</p>
            <p>This makes effort visible and acknowledged, without a conversation.</p>
            <p><strong>Treats</strong></p>
            <p>Partners can set small incentives that unlock after a few things are done.</p>
            <p>They're flexible and personal — and help keep momentum going.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">Why Nudge Works</h2>
            <p>Most tension around chores isn't about unwillingness — it's about getting started, forgetting, and effort going unnoticed.</p>
            <p>Nudge works because it:</p>
            <ul class="icon-list">
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span>Lowers the barrier to starting</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span>Avoids overwhelming lists</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span>Makes progress obvious</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span>Replaces reminders with visibility</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span>Avoids scores, streaks, and comparisons</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's designed to reduce friction, not track behaviour.</p>
        </article>

        <article class="bento-card project-section-card">
            <h2 class="card-title">Who It's For</h2>
            <p>Nudge is for couples who:</p>
            <ul class="icon-list">
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span>Want fewer arguments about everyday tasks</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span>Deal with imbalance or mental load</span></li>
                <li><span class="icon">●</span><span>Need something simpler than a shared to-do list</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's especially useful when ADHD, stress, or busy schedules get in the way.</p>

            <h2 class="card-title">The Idea Behind Nudge</h2>
            <p>Getting things done shouldn't require repeated conversations.</p>
            <p>Nudge gives couples a clearer, calmer way to handle the small stuff — so it doesn't turn into bigger problems.</p>
