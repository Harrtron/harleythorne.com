                    <p>I'm a founder-level operator who takes ownership of unclear, high-impact problems. I move fast, ship early, and iterate with real users. My work sits at the intersection of product, growth, and execution—turning vision into reality across all three.</p>
                    <p>I co-founded FanHub, a sports loyalty platform that grew from concept to 50k+ monthly active users and $3m+ in venture funding. I owned product, growth, commercial strategy, and operations end-to-end, stepping into whatever area was most critical at each stage. The experience taught me that building something from zero to live users to revenue requires equal parts imagination and execution.</p>
                    <p>I'm most effective when trusted with ownership of outcomes—making decisions with incomplete information, building teams and systems that create momentum, and shaping culture through clarity and high standards rather than process. I'm drawn to ambiguous problems, fast-moving environments, and the kind of work where you're creating something that didn't exist before.</p>
